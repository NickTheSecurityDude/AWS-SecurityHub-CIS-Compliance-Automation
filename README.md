# Automate AWS SecurityHub CIS, PCI and AWS Security Best Practice Compliance

## A new AWS Account is only 39% CIS Compliant by default

This script will help you achieve 100%, or nearly 100%, compliance.

The only manual steup is to setup Hardware MFA for the root user.

For this I use a Yubi key and enable U2F hardware MFA in the AWS Console.

This will script will trigger CloudWatch Alarms for CIS violations, which will then send an email alert, as well as an alert to Slack.

#
#  Description: Helps automate the CIS, PCI and AWS Security Best Practice compliance checks in SecurityHub
#
#  Prerequisistes: 1. Enable MFA for root account
#                  2. Upload the templates and lambda folders to s3 bucket
#                  3. Create a Slack channel named: security-incident-response
#                     and create a Slack web hook
#
#  Recommendations: Setup accounts using Account Factory in Control Tower with no VPCs enabled
#
#  Instructions: 1. Enter the variables below
#                2. Assume a role which can assume a cross account admin role in the GuardDuty
#                   main account and target accounts
#                3. This script can be run step by step or it can run all steps at once (option 0)
#                DO NOT RUN THE CLOUDFORMATION STACK DIRECTLY, THIS SCRIPT WILL RUN IT
#
#  Notes: Occassionally and update by AWS to config rules will trigger false positive alarms.  For example
#         while developing this AWS released a fix deployment for Lambda.2, which swapped the underlying configRule,
#         which resulted in SecurityHub getting an access denied message for the config
#         rule: lambda-function-settings-check*
#         No action is necessary to remediate these as they will fix themselves within 24 hours.
#
#  Disclaimer: For informational and educational purposes only, not for production use.  CIS
#              requirements are contantly changing, changes to this script and additional
#              steps are necessary.  This script launches AWS resources which may not be included in their free tier.

```

Run the script as follows:

Clone the git repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/NickTheSecurityDude/AWS-SecurityHub-CIS-Compliance-Automation.git
cd AWS-SecurityHub-CIS-Compliance-Automation
```

Upload the templates and lambda folders to your S3 bucket.

Enter the following variables in cis-pci-sbp-remediate.py
```
#Required Variables

# Target Account = Account to make CIS compliant
target_acct=""

# Email of target account
target_email=""

# Email you want to use for SNS topics
sns_email=""

# Account ID of your GuardDuty Account, as well as the detector ID
gd_main_acct=""
gd_main_acct_detector_id=""

# Admin role, if you use Control Tower you can use AWSControlTowerExecution
admin_role="AWSControlTowerExecution"

# Required CloudFormation Variables
# Camel case used for CF variable names to match CloudFormation variable naming convention
pS3Bucket=""
pLambdaBucket=""
pMasterAcct=""
pOrgId=""
pSlackWebHook=""
```

I recommond connecting to the CLI using SSO and selecting a user which can assume the admin_role you set above in the required accounts.

This script has been tested in us-east-1.

And run the script, choosing option 0 to run all steps:
```
aws configure sso
export AWS_PROFILE=your_profile_name
aws sts get-caller-identity
python3 cis-pci-sbp-remediate.py
```

![All Steps ScreenShot](https://i.postimg.cc/XJbPKdRn/cis-allsteps-0.png)

The script will take about 15-20 minutes to complete.

You will see output similar to this:
```
Performing all steps
Step 1: Launching CloudFormation Stack
Waiting for CF Stack
...
Step 2: Enabling GuardDuty
...
Step 3: Removing default Security Group Rules
200
200
Step 4: Updating Password Policy
Step 5: Enabling S3 Secure Transport
204
204
204
Step 6: Enable PCI Standards
...
Waiting 1 minute for PCI standards to be enabled
Step 7: Disable CRR Rule
...
Step 8: Enable VPC for Control Tower Lambda
Wait 60 seconds for policy to become active
Lambda CT VPC Found
Successful
Exiting...
```

Remember to confirm the SNS email subscription.

SecurityHub will take 24 hours to update, however after a few hours if you click on the individual controls they should show as Passed/Compliant.

When you view the results again, it will look like this:
